    \justifying{
        \large{
            \paragraph{} The amount of data being generated and collected in the modern world is significantly increasing day by day. As the popularity of the internet and social networks is also rising, large data has been sent all over the world without considering their security level. As a result, the importance of information security has also increased and steganography has emerged as one of the standards for secure communication. 
            \paragraph{} Digital steganography is the practice of representing information within a multimedia file such as text, picture or video, in such a manner that the presence of the information is not evident to third parties. Although image steganography has been used extensively in the past years, video steganography has also become widely popular and preferred recently, due to its high data hiding capacity and robustness. However, many of the existing methods of video steganography suffer deterioration of visual quality when the embedding capacity is increased. In order to avoid this, the proposed method uses enhanced Vigenere cipher for frame selection, which significantly improves the level of security without using complex operations, and adaptive inverted LSB332 for data hiding, which embeds video files with high capacity, high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and high structural similarity index measure (SSIM). The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves over 65 dB PSNR and 0.99 SSIM values at 20 kbits data capacity. It has also achieved nearly 55 dB and 50 dB PSNR values at 200 kbits and 500 kbits data capacities, respectively, without appreciable loss in the SSIM value. Hence, as the embedding capacity increases, the proposed method is found to be much better in terms of visual quality, than existing video data hiding methods.
